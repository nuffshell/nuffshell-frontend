      <Paragraph>
        Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. From all of
        us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends.
        There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Fluff it
        up a little and hypnotize it. If we're going to have animals around we
        all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Now, we're
        going to fluff this cloud.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the
        framework first. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on
        canvas. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Isn't that fantastic
        that you can make whole mountains in minutes? I started painting as a
        hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe
        talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Maybe he
        has a little friend that lives right over here.

      <Paragraph>
        The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. A tree
        cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Don't kill all your dark
        areas - you need them to show the light. Trees grow however makes them
        happy. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium
        white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap
        green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Water's like me. It's laaazy… Boy,
        it always looks for the easiest way to do things
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. How to
        paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. You've got to
        learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them
        happen. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. The very
        fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed
        that you're alive and can experience it.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        I'm a water fanatic. I love water. We can always carry this a step
        further. There's really no end to this. I sincerely wish for you every
        possible joy life could bring. We don't really know where this goes -
        and I'm not sure we really care. Imagination is the key to painting.
        They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But
        sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Learn when to stop. We can fix anything. If these lines aren't straight,
        your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor
        wet. That's a son of a gun of a cloud.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use -
        and make something beautiful out of it. It's almost like something out
        of a fairytale book. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a
        friend. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it
        is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. You create the
        dream - then you bring it into your world. Maybe there's a happy little
        Evergreen that lives here.

        You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use -
        and make something beautiful out of it. It's almost like something out
        of a fairytale book. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a
        friend. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it
        is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. You create the
        dream - then you bring it into your world. Maybe there's a happy little
        Evergreen that lives here.
